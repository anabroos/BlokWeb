<h2>we say</h2>
<p>Bashful Bunny with Christmas Tree adores hugs. In fact, she believes every season is hugging season – but Christmas? 
    That’s peak cuddle time. She’s been counting down since midsummer, ears twitching at the thought of mince pies, fairy lights, 
    and maximum snuggle opportunities. This year, she’s picked the perfect tree (small, spruce, extremely portable) and 
    she’s not letting go. It’s soft, it’s sparkly, and it smells vaguely of cinnamon. (Well, she says it does. 
    You won’t need to ask for a hug when this bunny’s around.</p>
